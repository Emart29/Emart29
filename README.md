## 🧭 What I'm About

I sit at the intersection of **machine learning engineering** and **product thinking** — turning raw data into reliable, explainable, production-ready AI systems. Whether it's a RAG pipeline answering questions over complex documents, an ML model predicting health risk, or an LLM evaluation framework catching reasoning failures before they reach users — I focus on building things that **actually work in the real world**.

> *"A model that can't be deployed is just a very expensive experiment."*

## 🔬 Current Focus

- 🏗️ Building **production-grade ML pipelines** with observability, evaluation, and monitoring baked in
- 🧠 Exploring **LLM reasoning diagnostics** — understanding *why* models fail, not just *when*
- 🔍 Developing **RAG systems** that go beyond naive retrieval — semantic chunking, hybrid search, real-time ingestion
- 📊 Automating **ML quality gates** to catch prompt regressions before they ship

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🫀 [Heart Disease Risk Prediction System](https://github.com/Emart29/Heart-Disease-Prediction)
> End-to-end ML system · 88.5% accuracy · FastAPI + Streamlit + SHAP + MLflow + Docker

A production-ready healthcare ML system built the right way — not just a notebook, but a deployable service with explainability (SHAP), experiment tracking (MLflow), a REST API, an interactive dashboard, and full Docker support. Built for trust, not just performance.

---

### 🔍 [LLM Reasoning Evaluation Framework](https://github.com/Emart29/llm-reasoning-eval)
> Research-grade diagnostics for multi-step reasoning failures in LLMs

Most LLM evals tell you a model is wrong. This framework tells you *where* the reasoning broke down. Designed to surface failure modes in chain-of-thought reasoning — useful for anyone building reliable LLM-powered products.

---

### 📄 [RAG Document Analyzer](https://github.com/Emart29/rag-document-analyzer)
> Production RAG system · FastAPI + React + ChromaDB + LLM observability

A full-stack document Q&A system with integrated LLM observability and monitoring. Goes beyond basic retrieval with real observability into how the system answers — not just what it answers.

---

### 🛡️ [LLM Quality Gate](https://github.com/Emart29/llm-quality-gate)
> Automated prompt regression detection · CI/CD for LLMs

A production-grade evaluation pipeline that automatically catches quality regressions before prompts reach users. Think CI/CD, but for LLM behavior — because shipping a broken prompt is just as bad as shipping broken code.

## 🤝 Let's Build Something

I'm open to collaboration on:
- **Production ML systems** — from model to API to deployment
- **AI-powered data products** — real-time insights, dashboards, automation
- **LLM evaluation & reliability** — making AI systems you can actually trust
- **Real-world automation** — turning workflows into intelligent pipelines

If you're building something ambitious and need an ML engineer who thinks beyond the notebook, let's talk.
